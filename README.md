# 366-DSA-Problems

## ðŸ§  About this Challenge

Iâ€™m challenging myself to solve **366 problems** focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
This is not a daily challenge â€” my goal is to complete them all, regardless of how long it takes.

These problems come from multiple sources:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)
- Exercises from my **Data Structures professor**
- Some challenges generated by **AI**
- Any other interesting or original problems I may encounter

- ---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To improve my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and mastery of core data structures.

Iâ€™ll be using this repo to:
- Track my progress
- Organize solutions by difficulty/topic/source
- Reflect on my learning along the way
